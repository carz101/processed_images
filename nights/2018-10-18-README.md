## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ 'AutoFlat-PANoRot-B-Bin1-006.fit' -- There is a bright spot on this image not present in other Flats
+ 'AutoFlat-PANoRot-B-Bin1-007.fit' -- Another unusual bright spot
+ 'AutoFlat-PANoRot-g-Bin1-008.fit' -- Couple bright spots here too
+ 'AutoFlat-PANoRot-r-Bin1-003.fit' -- Pair of bright spots
+ 'AutoFlat-PANoRot-r-Bin1-004.fit' -- Same pair of bright spots
+ 'AutoFlat-PANoRot-r-Bin1-006.fit' --Even more intense bright spot
+ 'M 31-S001-R001-C001-B.fit' -- B filter has lines at the edge of the images, as evidenced in this image
+ 'M 31-S001-R001-C001-g.fit' -- g filter also has lines on the very edge, but they're much darker

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [X] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [X] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.




## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nada, I'm not good at Python.
